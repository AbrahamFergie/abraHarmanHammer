JOIN:
  Question 1:
  The first example shows the goal scored by a player with the last name 'Bender'. The * says to list all the columns in the table - a shorter way of saying matchid, teamid, player, gtime

  Modify it to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. To identify German players, check for: teamid = 'GER'
  SELECT matchid, player FROM goal
  WHERE teamid = 'GER'

  Question 2:
  From the previous query you can see that Lars Benders scored a goal in game 1012. Now we want to know what teams were playing in that match.
  Notice in the that the column matchid in the goal table corresponds to the id column in the game table. We can look up information about game 1012 by finding that row in the game table.
  Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for just game 1012
  SELECT id,stadium,team1,team2
    FROM game
   WHERE id = 1012
